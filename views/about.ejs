                    <div class="box paragraph">
                        <p class="about-text">My journey in computer science all started when I was a sophomore in high school where we were 
                            required to pick some electives to take, and one of the classes caught my eye. The class was an 
                            introductory course in web design. We started out using Wix to make websites, and then towards the 
                            end of the course we dipped our toes in some HTML and CSS. Then in my junior year my math teacher 
                            announced during class that students were eligible to take a new full year course the school was 
                            offering in computer programming instead of taking a math course senior year. It seemed very 
                            interesting, so I did it and learned a little about programming in Visual Basic, which inspired me 
                            to research more about programming over the summer and teach myself some beginner level Python. The 
                            satisfying feeling of trying to figure out problems and writing code and debugging it until it 
                            finally works is something I’ve never felt so strong before, and I knew that computer science was 
                            what I needed to get into for the future at that point.

                        <p class="about-text">If you want someone that is passionate about their job, and cares greatly about their craft, I’m 
                            the guy for you. I’ve always had an extremely deep drive inside of me that pushes me to keep 
                            going and to always strive for what I want to do in life. That deep drive has helped me so much 
                            when having to perform hard tasks or figure out problems that seem impossible at the start. I 
                            can bring that drive on the job and be a great help for you and your team, while also having an 
                            open mind in what I need to do or learn to get better. I’ve also have done a lot of work in 
                            team-oriented environments, from playing team sports from elementary school through high school, 
                            to working in larger software projects in a scrum team in college. I’ve had so much experience 
                            working in teams that it makes sense that I would go into a profession that lays a huge 
                            importance on teamwork as well. I will make sure that I am doing all I can to not slow my 
                            team down, and ask many questions and try everything I can do to help team members that are 
                            having trouble. This is the type of dedication that you can expect on a daily basis if you pick
                            me to be a part of your team.

                        <p>I started playing hockey when I was little with friends and always enjoyed playing goalie. 
                            People usually think that’s weird, but there’s something about making that crazy save and 
                            keeping your team in the game when you shouldn’t be that just feels amazing. I never got into 
                            organized hockey growing up because I always played football, but in high school I realized 
                            that that was the sport I really wanted to play. I never skated in my life or played a single 
                            real game, I would always just play it with friends and goof around a lot during it. However, 
                            that wasn’t going to stop me from trying. I took skating lessons for a year and went to a 
                            goalie camp and worked in certain training programs to aid me in doing what I wanted to do 
                            and eventually joined the hockey club at my high school. It was rough at first as it was hard 
                            to keep up with people that have already been playing the game their whole life, but the time 
                            finally came to be called into my first game against a very good team that was blowing us out. 
                            I stuck to the skills that I’ve learned through my training and built up at practice and 
                            managed to only let up a couple of goals. This experience made me realize how much hard work 
                            really can get you in your life and is a philosophy I always think of whenever I am struggling 
                            with something. </p>

                    <div class="box-paragraph hobbies">
                        <p>Fishing has always been my biggest hobby since I could walk, it’s something that I find so 
                            relaxing yet exciting at the same time. I’ve always enjoyed bass fishing and would occasionally 
                            fish for trout and salmon in Wisconsin with my family. The most important lesson I’ve learned 
                            from fishing like any other fisherman is the power of patience, as you can’t just rush a fish 
                            onto your line. Sometimes you have experiences in life where you have to perform something over 
                            time in order to get the results you want and is something that can even make or break whatever 
                            you’re trying to do.This is something else I’ve always had to remind myself of over the years 
                            as sometimes you just want something to be done overnight or instantaneously, but sometimes 
                            that’s just not possible. Rushing is not a good habit to have as it can mess everything up you 
                            were working for in the first place. It isn’t worth it at the end of the day unless you’re 
                            literally forced to do it. This is something that I try to think of whenever learning a new 
                            skill, as if you try to rush to learn it you won’t fully grasp it, and if you aren’t persistent 
                            you won’t learn it in the first place. Persistence is key, and it’s something that I believe can 
                            get people over even an Everest sized hump in their life.</p>

                        <p>I’ve spent my later years in high school volunteering at the St Vincent de Paul food pantry in 
                            Lake Zurich Illinois at St. Francis. During my time there I met so many different walks of life 
                            and worked with people of such different age groups as well. I believe it was a great experience 
                            for me to have. I would stock shelves on Saturdays and then aid in getting everyone their food 
                            on Thursdays, which involved walking people around the shelves and letting them know how much 
                            food they can pick and helping some of them put it in their bags. I would also switch between 
                            doing that and labeling bags that were already packaged for people by their number as well as 
                            carrying bags out to their cars. Everyone that volunteered there was very nice, and I appreciate 
                            the time that I spent there. I think that it’s something that everyone should do in their 
                            lifetime and experience how important community really is in the world. </p>
